Blaeu, creating measurements on RIPE Atlas probes
=================================================

This is a set of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs to start
distributed Internet measurements on the network of
[RIPE Atlas probes](https://atlas.ripe.net/), and to analyze their results.

For installation, you can use usual Python tools, for instance:

```
pip3 install blaeu
```

[my article at RIPE Labs](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/stephane_bortzmeyer/using-ripe-atlas-to-debug-network-connectivity-problems),
although the tools' installation method and names are now different.

Blaeu requires Python 3.

Note that
[the old version](https://github.com/RIPE-Atlas-Community/ripe-atlas-community-contrib)
ran on Python 2 but is no longer maintained.

Name
----

It comes from the [famous Dutch cartographer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Blaeu).
