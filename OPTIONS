-a : area of the probes (currently WW West North-Central South-Central North-East South-East)
-b : machine-readable output
-c : country of the probes
[ -d : used by --tests of reach --do_lookup of traceroute]
-e : Atlas tags to exclude
-f : IP prefix of the probes (WARNING: it has to be an exact prefix in the global routing table)
-g : use the probes of this previous measurement 
-h : help
-i : Atlas tags to include
[ -j : used by --protocol of traceroute, and --displayvalidation of resolve]
[ -k : used by --key of cert or --format of traceroute or --checkingdisabled of resolve]

-m : the ID of the measurement you want to analyze (instead of starting a new one)
-n : AS number of the probes
-o : display the relevant probes in the results
-p : percentage of responding probes required (better not use it)
[ -q : used by --type of resolve]
-r : number of probes you ask for
-s : list of probes to use (comma-separated)
-t : port number (not used by all programs)
[ -u : AVAILABLE ]
-v : verbose
-w : spread (jitter)
