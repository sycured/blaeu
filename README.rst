Blaeu, creating measurements on RIPE Atlas probes
=================================================

This is a set of `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ programs to start
distributed Internet measurements on the network of `RIPE Atlas
probes <https://atlas.ripe.net/>`__.

For installation and examples, see `my article at RIPE
Labs <https://labs.ripe.net/Members/stephane_bortzmeyer/using-ripe-atlas-to-debug-network-connectivity-problems>`__.

Blaeu requires Python 3.

Note that `the old
version <https://github.com/RIPE-Atlas-Community/ripe-atlas-community-contrib>`__
ran on Python 2 but is no longer maintained.
